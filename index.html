    <p>this is a local new repo</p>
    <p>Branch Command</p>
    <p>git branch - to check the branch</p>
    <p>git branch -M main - to rename the branch</p>
    <p>git checkout BranchName - to switch the branch (to navigate)</p>
    <p>git checkout -b NewBranchName - to create a new branch</p>
    <p>
      git diff branchName - to check the difference(to compare commits,branches,
      files and more)
    </p>
    <p>git merge BranchName - to merge the branch</p>
    <p>git branch -d BranchName - to delete the branch</p>
    <p>git remote -v</p>
    <p>git remote rm origin</p>
    <p>
      git remote add origin
      https://github.com/meghanapatel7393-hub/apnacollege-demo.git
    </p>
    <p>git remote -v</p>
    <p>git push -u origin main - to push the branch</p>

    <p><strong>way 2 to merge branches</strong></p>
    <p>create a PR - Pull Request</p>
    <p>
      Pull request - it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to
      branch in a repository on GitHub
    </p>
    <p>create a PR - to merge the branch</p>

    <p>
      after merge the brnach code we need to pull all latest udate from github
      to local main branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      for that use Pull COmmand that helps us to pull all latest udate from
      github to local main branch
    </p>
    <p>
      git pull origin main - this command get all latest udate from github to
      local main branch
    </p>
    <p>
      used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediatly
      update the local repo to match that content
    </p>

    <p><strong>Resolving Merge Conflicts - bhvesh</strong></p>

    <p>
      an event that take place when git is unable to automaticaly resolve
      differences in code between two branches/commits
    </p>

    <p>git merge --abort - to abort the merge</p>
    <p>git merge --continue - to continue the merge</p>
    <p>git merge --skip - to skip the merge</p>

      <strong
        >Undoing Changes - this is used when we want to undo changes.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      case 1: staged changes <br />
      git reset fileName - used this command when reset one in file <br />
      git reset - used this command when reset all last added changes <br />-
      stated changes means only add but not commit
    </p>
    <p>
      case 2: commited changes (for one commit) <br />
      git reset HEAD~1 -> hear HEAD~1 means ((last commit is HEAD~1)) undo last
      commit - used only for single commit
    </p>
    <p>
      case 3: commited changes (for multiple commits) <br />
      git reset &lt;commit hash&gt; <br />
      - here hash means commit id or commit hash. if we want back from commit 3
      to commit 1 then we need to use commit hash of commit 1 hash <br />
      that hash we can check or get using git log command. <br /><br />
      git reset --hard &lt;commit hash&gt; - using this command we can undo
      multiple commits at once. and that remove all the commit history from vs
      code and git also --hard is used with reset.
    </p>

    <p>
      git log - used this command to see all commit history with commit id/hash
    </p>

    <p><strong>Fork</strong> - a copy of a repository</p>
    <p>A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility setting with the original "upstream" repository</p>
    <p>Fork is a rough copy</p>
    <p>git fork - to create a fork</p>
    <p> using fork command we can create a copy of other repository to our repository also</p>
